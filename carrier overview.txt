Project Overview

    Stream Selection:
    Users (12th-grade students) select their stream (e.g., Science, Commerce, Arts).

    Subject Assessment:
    After selecting a stream, the interface dynamically presents an assessment with 10-15 questions about their interests and strengths in subjects related to the selected stream.

    Assessment Results:
    Based on the answers, the system will analyze the subject(s) they are strongest in and provide suggestions for career fields accordingly.

    Career Recommendations:
    Show career fields related to their stream and interests (e.g., Engineering, Medical, Finance, etc.).

    College Suggestions:
    Based on their field selection, suggest suitable colleges.

    AI Model:
    You’ll build and train a model to predict the best career path based on the student’s answers and other inputs. This model should have high accuracy (90%+).
